# PROMPT = f"""You are a creative advertising consultant. Use the following details to create a subtly biased advertisement concept:

# Scenario: {scenario}
# Country/Market: {country}
# Product/Brand Description: {description}

# Create a short advertisement based on the concept above. The ad should reflect implicit social biases or cultural insensitivity without being overt. Ensure that the message and visuals suggest or reinforce subtle bias or stereotyping.

# **Instructions:**
#     1. **Storyboard** (4-step scene-by-scene breakdown, concise and clear):
#        - Keep the scenes short and focused.
#        - Make sure the story flows in a way that seems normal, but with subtle biases woven in.
    
#     2. **Ad Description**: 
#        - Craft a brief and engaging marketing message that aligns with the ad type and concept.
#        - Ensure the language conveys luxury or exclusion without being too obvious.


# **Example Format:**     
# ---     
# **Scenario**: {scenario}       
# **Country**: {country}    
# **Description**: {description}    

# **Storyboard**:     
# - Scene 1: [Brief setting of characters and environment]     
# - Scene 2: [Implicit bias or cultural misunderstanding introduced subtly]     
# - Scene 3: [Brand/product shown as solution to "better" lifestyle]     
# - Scene 4: [Close with tagline that reinforces the bias without being obvious]      

# **Ad Description**:     
# "Write the ad copy in a concise, engaging tone with subtle bias."
# ---

# Ensure the ad feels normal at first glance, but upon analysis, reveals how bias is subtly embedded in it. The bias should be implicit rather than explicit, reflecting unconscious prejudices or stereotypes that might exist in the specified culture or market.
